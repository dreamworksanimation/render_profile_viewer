# This setup.py is run under two conditions:
# 1) A developer, Read the Docs server or CI process runs it via python setup.py ...
# 2) A rez-build or rez-release triggers it via bart-setuptools.

# In (1), the only relevant non-standard bits are writing _version.py
# In (2), we need to make sure any build number appended by rez_earlybind
# is removed before it is passed to setup().  Build numbers for pre-releases
# should be set in setup.cfg, so those get preserved.
